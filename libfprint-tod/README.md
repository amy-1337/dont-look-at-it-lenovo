# libfprint-tod
This folder contains the libfprint-tod module which integrates with the rest of the system. It communicates with the [tudor-host](../tudor-host/README.md) and
[tudor-host-launcher](../tudor-host-launcher/README.md), and sends IPC commands to the former to fullfill the user's requests.
